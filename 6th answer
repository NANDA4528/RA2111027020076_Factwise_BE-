##6.If the numbers to are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
 
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
 
 
NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

Solution:
step1:first count the letters for letters from 1 to 9.
step2:Count letters for numbers from 10 to 19.
step3:Count letters for multiples of 10 from 20 to 90.
step4:Combine the results to cover all numbers from 1 to 99.
step5:Count letters for hundreds (100 to 999).
step6:Count letters for 1000.
Step7:Combine all totals:

##code:

units = ["", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]
teens = ["ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen"]
tens = ["", "", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]
hundreds = ["", "one hundred", "two hundred", "three hundred", "four hundred", "five hundred", "six hundred", "seven hundred", "eight hundred", "nine hundred"]

def count_letters(number):
    words = ""
    if number == 1000:
        words = "one thousand"
    elif number >= 100:
        words += hundreds[number // 100]
        if number % 100 != 0:
            words += " and " + count_letters(number % 100)
    elif number >= 20:
        words += tens[number // 10]
        if number % 10 != 0:
            words += " " + units[number % 10]
    elif number >= 10:
        words += teens[number - 10]
    else:
        words += units[number]
    return words.replace(" ", "")

total_letters = sum(len(count_letters(i)) for i in range(1, 1001))
print(total_letters)
